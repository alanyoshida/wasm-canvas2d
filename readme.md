# WebAssembly Canvas2D example

A simple animation on Canvas2D with WebAssembly. [See it live](https://subzey.github.io/wasm-canvas2d/)

Though it's not very valuable in terms of aesthetics, that example could help someone to dive into WebAssembly. It features:

- Calls of JS functions from WebAssembly
- Calls of WebAsm functions from JS
- Using stack
- Using simple loops
